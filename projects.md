* **[Domain](./domain.html)**: Machine Learning models under-perform when input domain changes; some examples of domain drift for an automatic speech recognition system are: new or unknown accent, dialect or vernacular. How do we generalize or adapt to new domains? 
* **[ML-service](./mlservice.html)**: ML Services are trained with one-size-fits-all policy and are deployed in the wild. How can we improve the generalizability of the service?
* **[Limited Data](./ldata.html)**:
