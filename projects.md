More information can be found in the following theme specific pages.

* **[Time](./time.html)**:  
* **[Domain](./domain.html)**: Machine Trained models stumble when input domain changes; for example new accent, language dialect, vernacular for an automatic speech recognition system. How do we generalize, adapt to new domains? 
* **[ML-service](./mlservice.html)**: How can we make Machine Learning (ML) services more useful? Parameter update free on-the-fly adaptation to new domains. Human-in-loop accuracy guarantees. 
* **[Limited Data](./ldata.html)**:
