# Ongoing Projects

More information can be found in the following theme specific pages.

* **[Time-series](./time.html)**: How best to forecast a predictive variable if we are interested in a specific aggregate measure of the forecasted values? For example, how do we model if we are not interested in the absolute values but only top quartile? 
* **[Domain](./domain.html)**: Machine Learning models under-perform when input domain changes; some examples of domain drift for an automatic speech recognition system are: new or unknown accent, dialect or vernacular. How do we generalize or adapt to new domains? 
* **[ML-service](./mlservice.html)**: ML Services are trained with one-size-fits-all policy and are deployed in the wild. How can we improve the generalizability of the service?
* **[Limited Labeled Data](./ldata.html)**: In what ways could we reduce the need of labeled data used for training large Deep Learning models? We explore ways of harnessing human supervision beyond collection of just the gold labels, effective data collection under strict budgets, exploting language relatedness for multilingual NLP, and adaptation of ML models trained in data-abundant domains to data-constrained domains.
