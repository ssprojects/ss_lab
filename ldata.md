title: Learning from limited labeled data
---

# Learning from limited labeled data
Deep learning models are data hungry and annotating large datasets is a pain-staking process. One of the primary focus of our group is to develop methods to enable Deep Learning for Speech and Natural Language processing in low resource and limited labeled data settings.
